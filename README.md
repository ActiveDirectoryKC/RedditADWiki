# r/ActiveDirectory Reddit Wiki 
This is intended to be an off-reddit / backup / test resource of all the wiki items from the [https://www.reddit.com/r/activedirectory/wiki/index/](https://www.reddit.com/r/activedirectory/wiki/index/) wiki. There is nothing against the Reddit Wiki except that it does not allow for some management actions. Rather than depending on that solely, this was created to give the mods a place to discuss layout and review changes collectively before we roll them into the reddit wiki. There is also the reality that reddit goes down semi-frequently so this provides an off-reddit backup of the information we've collected. 

The actual wiki portion starts at the Index folder  [https://github.com/ActiveDirectoryKC/RedditADWiki/tree/main/Index](https://github.com/ActiveDirectoryKC/RedditADWiki/tree/main/Index).

Please [message the reddit mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/activedirectory) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/ActiveDirectoryKC/RedditADWiki/issues) if something needs updated.
