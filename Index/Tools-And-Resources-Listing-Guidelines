# AD Tools Reviews Guidelines
Ideally, every tool on the list would be reviewed by the moderators and updated accordingly. However, there are a lot of tools and a few of us. To keep it simple here's the guidelines we operate off of for tools.

## Tool Listing Guidelines
1. A tool must be useful to AD or the security of AD.
   1. There is some subjectivity here, but in general it fits. 
2. A tool must be __mostly__ free to use. Free trials will only be considered if they evolve into a freeware tool that isn't too spammy. 
3. Tools made by third parties are 100% okay as long as they meet all the other guidelines on this list. This is true even if they have a paid version that enhances features.
   > The subreddit does not specifically recommending any vendor's paid product outside of the immediate Micrsoft ecosystem. That said, the mods and the community have clear preferences and may voice them accordingly.
4. Any submitted tool should be a least reviewed before listing to make sure it doesn't appear to be a scam, illegitimate, or malware. 
   1. Note, you may submit other's work as long as you submit it as their work. If you fork a repo or claim a tool is yours and we find out, your version removed and blacklisted and you will be banned. 
5. Moderators may list any tool they find useful and star mark it as starred after agreement from the majority of moderators. 
6. Tools submitted to be added by "Approved Users" and/or the Tech Council will be added if they meet the guidelines on this page. 
7. Starred tools must be fully reviewed by the mods. 

## Submitting a Tool to Be Added/Removed
 > Eventually I forsee this being a google form, but for now this is how we're doing it.
1. Send a modmail requesting a tool be added/removed to the wiki/resources sticky. 
   1. In the mod mail provide a link to the tool, a brief description, and why you think it should be added. 
2. The moderators will review the request and either add it or provide a reason why it won't be added.
3. There is no guarantee your tool will be added and by having your tool added it is not necessarily a recommendation from the subreddit or its mods. 

## Note on Reviews
Detailed reviews should eventually be posted and published somewhere, but there isn't a good place for that currently. Keep an eye open for that information
