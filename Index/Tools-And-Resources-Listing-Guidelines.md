# AD Tools and Resource Listing Guidelines

Ideally, every tool on the list would be reviewed by the moderators and updated accordingly. However, there are a lot of tools and a few of us. To keep it simple here's the guidelines we operate off of for tools.

# Tool/Resource Listing Guidelines

1. A resource/tool must be useful to AD or the security of AD.
   1. There is some subjectivity here, but in general it fits.
2. A resource should not be paywalled and should not require sign-up or providing of an email for the resource.
   * An example is a lot of sites have a "Guide to do XYZ in Active Directory" and you have to provide an email, these will be rejected.
   * Exception would be some Microsoft first-party downloads require emails sometimes.
3. A tool must be **mostly** free to use. Free trials will only be considered if they evolve into a freeware tool that isn't too spammy.
4. Tools made by third parties are 100% okay as long as they meet all the other guidelines on this list. This is true even if they have a paid version that enhances features.The subreddit does not specifically recommending any vendor's paid product outside of the immediate Micrsoft ecosystem. That said, the mods and the community have clear preferences and may voice them accordingly.
5. Any submitted tool or resource should be a least reviewed before listing to make sure it doesn't appear to be a scam, illegitimate, or malware.
   1. Note, you may submit other's work as long as you submit it as their work. If you fork a repo or claim a tool is yours and we find out, your version removed and blacklisted and you will be banned.
6. Moderators may list any tool or resource they find useful and star mark it as starred after agreement from the majority of moderators.
7. Tools or Resources submitted to be added by "Approved Users" and/or the Tech Council will be added if they meet the guidelines on this page.
8. Starred Tools or Resources must be fully reviewed by the mods.
9. If a tool or resource is changed in a way that violates these rules, it can and will be removed. Please notify the admins using the below process to get these updated if you find one.

# Submitting a Tool to Be Added/Removed

1. Visit our subreddit github and submit an issue: Â [https://github.com/ActiveDirectoryKC/RedditADWiki/issues](https://github.com/ActiveDirectoryKC/RedditADWiki/issues)
2. For adding a new resource/tool, provide a link to the tool, a brief description, and why it should be added.
3. For removing/updating a resource, provide a link to the existing resource page, the name, and what needs changed.
4. The moderators will review the request and either add it or provide a reason why it won't be added.
5. There is no guarantee your tool or resource will be added and by having your tool added it is not necessarily a recommendation from the subreddit or its mods.

>**Note on Reviews**  
Detailed reviews should eventually be posted and published somewhere, but there isn't a good place for that currently. Keep an eye open for that information
