Welcome to the /r/ActiveDirectory wiki! The wiki is divided into two sections: resources and subreddit information. Resources will contain the collections of resource links, notes, etc. Subreddit Information will contain general subreddit information including rules, any subreddit charter information, and more.

## GitHub Wiki Backup
We are also maintaining a, mostly, up-to-date copy of the wiki in GitHub as a just-in-case. We'll move any changes from there to here periodically. The content will be same but different formatting.
