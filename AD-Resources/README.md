# Scanning and Auditing Tools

>All these tools are great assets for scanning and remediation. Be warned some may trip EDR/Antivrius scanners and all will likely alert breach detection tools. Make sure your SOC and Cybersecurity team knows you're running these and gives permission.

* ❗✨Purple Knight (Semperis)
   * This is a free tool by Semperis that does a very comprehensive health check. Also checks PKI. This is a must run in every AD where you can run it.
   * Requires an email address which will get you a little bit of emailing from Semperis. Not too much compared to others and not tons of plugs for their paid software.
   * WILL PRVOKE EDR/IDTR SOLUTIONS!!! This does a lot of scans so many solutions will flag the activity.
   * [https://semperis.com/downloads/tools/pk/PurpleKnight-Community.zip](https://semperis.com/downloads/tools/pk/PurpleKnight-Community.zip)
* ❗Forest Druid (Semperis)
   * Another Semperis tool in line with Purple Knight, but this one focuses on securing highly privileged accounts (Tier 0 \[Domain Admins\]). Affectionately referred to as "Bloodhound lite".
   * [https://semperis.com/downloads/tools/fd/ForestDruid-Community.zip](https://semperis.com/downloads/tools/fd/ForestDruid-Community.zip)
* ❗PingCastle (Netwrix)
   * This is a freeium scanning tool that can give you at least a base-level security posture for your environment.
   * Netwrix is a little spammy with their products but recently-ish acquired PingCastle so we'll see where it goes..
   * [https://www.pingcastle.com/download/](https://www.pingcastle.com/download/)
* ❗Bloodhound (SpecterOps) \[WILL FLAG AV\]
   * [https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)
* Invoke-TrimarcADChecks (Trimarc) - [https://github.com/Trimarc/Invoke-TrimarcADChecks](https://github.com/Trimarc/Invoke-TrimarcADChecks)
  * Trimarc was aquired by TrustedSec so this may change at some point.
* ✨Locksmith - [https://github.com/jakehildreth/Locksmith](https://github.com/jakehildreth/Locksmith)
   * PKI Auditing and Checking Tool.
   * This is a must have when running PKI. Really good and there is a lot of active development on it (2025).
* ✨BlueTuxedo - https://github.com/jakehildreth/BlueTuxedo
   * "A tiny tool built to find an dfix common misconfigurations in AD-Integrated DNS..."
   * Finds stuff in DNS you may not find.
